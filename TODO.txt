TODO
==================================

- I have unsuccessfully tried to generate images on the fly with the
mermaid filter for pandoc. The issue might be related to sandboxing
in the Ubuntu base image. It might be worth trying a different base image (e.g., debian, fedora).

I have been unable to get this working. I may revisit this in the future.
