# Preface

This book is another of the books I wanted to read but did not exist. I used AI to write it,
I don't want to hide that fact, so you can expect some errors in the text, but I have reviewed it and
corrected most of them. I have also added my own comments and explanations to some of the topics, so
you can get a better understanding of them. I have tried to make it as clear as possible, but if you
find any errors or have any suggestions, please let me know.

If you find any error, please contact me in jissbooks@gmail.com, and I'll correct them and update the book.
